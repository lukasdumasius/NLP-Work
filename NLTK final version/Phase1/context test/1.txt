We are the Titanium Titans, FIRST Robotics team 4467, and we are raising money for our 2016 robot build and competition!  The FIRST Robotics Competition provides high school students the opportunity to learn engineering and business skills to inspire them to pursue STEM as a career. The Titanium Titans have just entered our 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) build season, and we are reaching out for funding! The build season goes from January 9th to February 23rd, and in those six weeks our team must build the best robot possible to complete whatever task FIRST has presented us with at kickoff. This year, the game is called FIRST Stronghold, and is somewhat similar to a game of Storm the Castle. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOKzoHJDjA This is a great opportunity for high school students, however, it costs around $12,000 - $15,000 for the team to operate. We set our goal at $1000 in order to ensure a successful Kickstarter, but desire more to have a successful season. Our robot can cost up to $4,000 for parts and supplies, and each competition we register for is an additional $4,000, with a $1,000 fee for a kit of parts at the beginning of the season. We are currently registered for one competition, the Greater Pittsburgh Regional, and if we win, we will go to the FRC World Championship in St. Louis at the end of April. This trip would be another $5,000 in registration, and extra funds would be desired to offset some team members' costs for transportation and accommodations. Any and all donations are appreciated, and you get cool perks for donating larger amounts of money.
