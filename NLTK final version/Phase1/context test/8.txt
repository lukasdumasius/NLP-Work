A Workshop for Custom Wood Work ranging from Dog Houses to Custom build Gamer tables and Game Stations  Hello, my name is Harry I am very passionate about Wood Working, I have enjoyed making many projects such as Sheds, Skate Ramps, boats dog houses and many more items. I am raising money to pursue my dreams of owning my own Wood Work Business crafting custom built items, mostly dealing with custom dog houses and gaming stations, but open to many build ideas. I enjoy working closely with customers to come up with a unique idea of their very own! I get great satisfaction out of seeing my work make people and their pups happy.
