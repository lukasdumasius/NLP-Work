Our ladies sandals are handcrafted in Oaxaca, Mexico by a talented group of artisans in a family workshop. With 30 years of experience, these shoe makers have a knack for gorgeous fabric, distinct style, and a passion for quality. It is a labor of love from start to finish:  * Hand woven fabric  * Organic leather tanning  * Crafted by hand in a family owned workshop with over 30 years of experience Our sandals create a culture of unity, they embody a genuine connection between the consumer, the artisan, and the distance in-between.  Our Sandals The Laadi Collection These sandals are made with textiles woven on a pedal loom also in Oaxaca, Mexico. The artisans cut the fabric to make straps and uniquely tie, braid or wrap them to make comfortable sandals. The sandals are made in small batches depending on fabric availability. The available colors and styles will vary.     The Tapestry Collection These sandals are made with handwoven textiles on a more laborious tapestry loom. The yarn is also hand-dyed wool. Additional straps are added to some styles and all wool straps come with leather lining on the inside of the shoe adding extra comfort and quality. The sandals are made in small batches depending on fabric availability. The available colors and styles will vary.     The Artisans The artisan workshop is a woman run family workshop. Clara, along with her daughters and other family members have been crafting beautiful sandals for over 30 years. The entire process is done by hand including the leather tanning, soling, and adding gorgeous handwoven fabrics. Our textiles are woven by hand on a pedal loom.

She served in the Peace Corps in a rural indigenous village in Bolivia. She earned a Masters degree in Latin American Studies where she specializes in development studies and handcrafts in Bolivia.
