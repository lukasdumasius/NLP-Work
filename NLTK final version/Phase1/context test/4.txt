A community designed robot that gives everyone everywhere access to Artificial Intelligence via a fun little guy named BiBli.   BiBlis prep for a shipment to the Longmont Public Library  Hardware: An integrated Pi and Arduino powered by BiBli OS v 0.3  Robot stickers anyone? The BiBli engineering team pauses production to send out some stickers to community members. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.  Play Replay with sound Play with  sound 00:00 00:00  As seen at TedX Salon  Imagine if anyone anywhere had access to an intelligent, durable low cost robot?  Above: A Baby BiBli prototype Robots are a fun, effective way to work on things like communication, life skills and learning. But real robots are not yet accessible, durable or affordable.   Until now. Meet Baby BiBli...  The lowest cost truly intelligent robot and robot teaching kits are still several thousands of dollars and complicated to control and program. Not anymore. Meet Baby BiBli.  In 3 iterations we've brough BiBli robots down in cost 87%. With your help we can further reduce the cost and bring A.I. to the masses. By utilizing talented student engineers and by leveraging the collective input of you - the people who need and want a breakthrough device - we've come up with a robotics platform called BiBli. We have a vision to bring true artificial intelligence to the masses for as low as $99 per robot.  An early "Baby BiBli" prototype.  You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

How would you use your BiBli? What use could a fun, intelligent robot have in your business, school, library or home?  About Artificial Autism Artificial Autism is a research study designed to build a specific 'spectrum personality profile' for individuals and as a group with the goal of better understanding common traits, gifts and limitations amongst a given group of people. Data is anonymous. BiBli collects only usage and environmental feedback.   Watch a recent TEDx talk:    We hope one day to be able to visualize our personalities including identifying triggers and sensitivities.   Module contributed by QI Liu - a PhD candidate at CU Boulder.   In partnership with CU Boulder's Laboratory for Playful Computation Robots are fun but they are also fantastic teaching tools. BiBli was conceived at the Longmont Public Library in Longmont, Colorado.      Every BiBli is pre-installed with easy-to-use drag and drop software that makes it easy for students, teachers, parents and librarians to teach robotics curriculum, create custom routines and play a variety of media programs through BiBli.   Wei Miao is heading this research.  The original BiBli - photo Longmont Times-Call           Each BiBli is pre-loaded with BlockyTalky from Laboratory for Playful Computing at CU Boulder.  BiBli has been designed for K-12 Students. They wanted something human but not 'too human'.  Launching ROBAUTO at One Spark in 2013. The Craigslist robot guy didn't show.  Big BiBli is a permanent resident at the Longmont Public Library in Longmont, CO.  Just want a free laptop sticker? No problem. We'll get our sticker elves to mail one.
