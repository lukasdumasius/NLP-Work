Help in creating these one of kind flip-flops in support for Sen. Bernie Sanders!! ...25% of profits...may..be donated  While driving through Chicago in February, me and my girlfriend were discussing the Presidential Race. By a slip of the tongue she said, "Bernie Sandals". The idea was born. I had a personal friend, Jennifer Gamboa, create several different designs for the flip-flops (one of which is on this page). Leaving these last few months in search for a company to produce the idea; many gave quotes [between $1000-6000!] all of which are too high for our budgets. So we've come here, in hopes that the idea can still become reality! Thank you for your time and consideration!
