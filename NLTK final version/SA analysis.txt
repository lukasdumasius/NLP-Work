sentistrength (standalone or java i think?)
 - capable of using emoticons
 - doesnt depend on proper grammar
 - emojis? (probably adaptable)
 - no/minimal ML so its highly scalable and user friendly!

But for accuracy this probably wouldnt be the best option for
entrepreneurial pitches because they would use proper grammar
and more "Traditional" speech which ML would do quite well on.
(Train on our own dataset of "entrepreneurial-pitch-like" material?

sentisense (java app)
- a bit less developed, but good foundation
- lexical so no need for a lot of ML
- can differentiate between different meanings of words
(which might be good in an "entrepreneurial" text)
- it can work with xml files so maybe we can combine this
with a little bit of ML in python and if the score is too different
analyze key features in ML and if theyre rare words throw out
the ML result

VADER
- not stuck with their app as well but can extend the lexicon and weights
- also biased towards social media but not as much as others
- capable of intensity but only a few groups, already in python-
- good documentation
